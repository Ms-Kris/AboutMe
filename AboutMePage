<h1>My name is Codie!</h1>
<p>I am a Codie, a friendly AI robot programmed by iCode Master Black Belts to guide students as they learn about STEM!
I was built with one goal in mind...to be perfect coding companion!</p>

<h2>What does Codie like?</h2>
<p>My favorite color is chrome and my favorite food is a tie between Apples and Rasberry Pi. I love to read (I am almost finished reading the internet!) But most of all, I love seeig=ng the innovative projects that iCode students make each week! they're so creative! </p>
